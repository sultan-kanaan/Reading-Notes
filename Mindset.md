>We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

### what I did when I started coding
* Try a solution.
* If that doesn’t work, try another one.
* If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

>what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

1. Understand

 Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them 

2. Plan
 
 Don’t dive right into solving without a plan , Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

3. Divide

 Do not try to solve one big problem , Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
 
 Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

4. Stuck?

 First off, take a deep breath. 

**Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!**

In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:
- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
- Sidenote: Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I’m serious. You’ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is.
- Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.


>Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with 

**Now, you know better what it means to “think like a programmer.”**
