## Twilio SendGrid account setup
>Before sending your first email, you will need to complete the following Twilio SendGrid account setup. These requirements help secure your account and keep your messages from landing in spam folders.

### Configure Two-factor authentication
Twilio SendGrid uses Two-factor authentication (2FA) to help protect your account. To enable 2FA, Navigate to Two-Factor Authentication in the Twilio SendGrid Settings menu, and click Add Two-Factor Authentication.

### API key
CAPI Keys authenticate your application, mail client, or website with Twilio SendGrid services. Unlike a username and password, API keys are scoped to provide access only to the services you select. You can also delete and create API keys without impacting your other account credentials. For these reasons, Twilio SendGrid requires you to connect to its services using API keys.

Create an API key
In the Twilio SendGrid App, navigate to API Keys in the Settings menu, and select Create API Key.

* A modal will open where you can create your key. You must name the API key â€” we recommend something that will clearly differentiate the key from others you may create in the future.

You must also select the type of key you want to create. Twilio SendGrid provides three types of API key:

1. Full Access
2. Restricted Access
3. Billing Access

* To keep your account secure, you should give each key the least privilege necessary. You can limit a key's capabilities by creating a Restricted Access key and selecting a subset of all the possible permissions. For more about managing Twilio SendGrid API keys, see the Twilio SendGrid API keys documentation.

### Sender Authentication
Twilio SendGrid requires customers to complete Sender Authentication. This requirement protects your domain's reputation as an email sender and helps uphold legitimate sending behavior by Twilio SendGrid customers.

Setup includes domain authentication. Twilio SendGrid will provide DNS records that you must add to your domain. For instructions on the domain authentication process, see "How to Set Up Domain Authentication."

### Change, unsubscribe, reactivate your Twilio SendGrid plan
You can upgrade or downgrade your Twilio SendGrid plan to accommodate your email sending needs as they change. If you no longer need the Twilio SendGrid service, you will aslo unsubscribe through the Azure portal.

From your Azure portal's Subscription overview page, select Resources and click your Twilio SendGrid resource (it is labeled "Contoso" in the following examples).
